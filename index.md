## About Me

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8Tw0RcA.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" />

Hi! I am a graduate of University of California, Irvine with a B.A. in Cognitive Psychology and a minor in Biology. 

My interests (outside of data science) are snowboarding, cycling, cooking, weight lifting, judo, reading (SciFi/Fantasy nerd), and video games.

## Research Interest

Many of my research interests stem from a year and a half working as a research assistant at the UCI Working Memory and Plasticity Lab. They include: working memory, learning, brain plasticity, and video game studies. I am also interested in personality factors (Big 5/ Grit) and epistemology of personality factors and intelligence testing.
